WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, cpuclk1/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clkIn 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'cpuclk1/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' is ignored by Vivado but preserved for implementation tool.
